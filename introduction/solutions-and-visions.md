# Solutions and Visions

## Solution

As described above, following the daily increase in the trend of e-commerce and the quick development of the blockchain industry, a combination of these two can provide mutual support and has already arrived at an incredibly pressing and urgent actual stage. By means of combining both of these, ShopFi trusts in all of these technological and developmental endpoints, in order to provide business with a friendlier ecology and atmosphere, providing people with a more aesthetic life and environment, and providing fecund soil and a foundation to finance. Through **ShopFi**, users can at any time and any place liberate themselves from territorial limitations, limitations on currency, and make use of the encrypted currency they have on hand in order to safety and efficiently purchase goods and services on a worldwide basis.

ShopFi provides a completely new mode in an innovative way to serve as a bridge between traditional e-commerce and blockchain, attracting broker nodes, making it possible to carry out the new ideas of ShopFi.

### **Privacy**

ShopFi has a deep appreciation of the importance of privacy, so there is a consistent effort placed on putting user privacy at the forefront. In the design of the ShopFi system, there has been comprehensive consideration of user privacy. In the ShopFi system, the user does not need to be concerned about his privacy, since protection of privacy in ShopFi is at the system level, the corresponding private information should only be minimally revealed, as show in the figure below:

When a user issues an order, public information is first stored in the blockchain (IPFS, Arweave, etc.), obtaining the stored Hash value, and at the same time key information and the transaction itself is submitted to a smart contract in order to obtain the transaction Hash value and system assigned node ID. Re-use of the node ID public key encrypted private information (such as the goods receipt information, etc.), uses Peer to Peer (P2P) technology to transmit information after encryption through an SSL tunnel to the corresponding distribution node. After the node receives this information, the node uses its own secret key to decrypt it, while also monitoring the smart contract for order events. After combining the smart contract, blockchain storage, and decrypted private data, the order information is formed, then distributes this to the broker for subsequent order processing, and then deletes the private data from the node itself. This kind of system design essentially guaranteed user privacy, and that information will not be divulged to the public blockchain and cloud storage.

The privacy protection of ShopFi is carried out through anonymity during purchasing of products, there is no need for registration on the shopping website, you can merely issue an order on ShopFi. As a result, there is no need to leak unnecessary information, avoiding tracing, especially in terms of online services.

### **Security**

The same as the measures employed in regards to privacy, ShopFi in the same way places security at the highest level of priority in considerations. The system adopts different measures to ensure funds security at every stage:

1\. The system uses smart contracts to ensure funds security from the start.\
During a transaction, the user's funds will not be directly paid to a broker or the seller of the shopping center, on the contrary, when both parties confirm the transaction, the funds will be continuously stopped within the ShopFi smart contract, and no one will be able to transfer out the funds there. Due to the same reasons, even if the order is deleted, both parties must also agree, otherwise the user will be unable to unilaterally withdraw his funds.\


2\. The mechanism of the system for brokers.\
For those who want to become ShopFi brokers, they must pledge a corresponding quota of cryptocurrency. These quotas will be held by the smart contract after each order and confirmed order, and can be released after the transaction is successfully completed. If there is a problem at any point in the process, after both parties reach an agreed-on consensus on how to handle the problem, the party may withdraw the funds or pledge.\


3\. The mechanism of the system for nodes.\
The design of the ShopFi network includes many distributed nodes all over the world, which need only pledge the corresponding $MNT and after this they may become one of the nodes of ShopFi. The notes are a very important area for ShopFi, since they are responsible for very important work. This includes automatic orders and payment processing, data synchronization, data authentication, arbitration, and information sending work, etc. The system has incentive mechanisms for the nodes, using Proof of Procedures (PoPs) as the working mechanism, the nodes must complete corresponding work flow in order to obtain token rewards, and if they go offline or have a high fault rate, then they shall receive a corresponding penalty.

### **Low costs**

Traditional shopping centers use credit cards like Visa or Mastercard or third-party payment platforms like Paypal, ApplePay, and Wechatpay, and aside from currency and area restrictions, users must pay many fees, but when using ShopFi for global goods shopping, users can enjoy the convenience of the blockchain, and benefit from very low payment costs and high efficiency confirmation times.

ShopFi will preferentially select public chain issuance that has a low fee public chain issuing, such as (BSC, Matic, and all Layer2 solutions based on Ethereum), in order to carry out highly effective confirmation times and low-cost payment costs. In future versions, the construction of a dedicated e-commerce chain is not out of the question in order to have a more unified user experience and various application advantages.

### **Dispute handling**

Different to traditional e-commerce platforms that use centralized methods of handling disputes, ShopFi will use more decentralized methods of answering disputes arising from transactions. If the purchaser and the agent encounter a problem that they cannot agree over, then it can be published on DApp for dispute handling, and those currency holders that are interested can state their point of view in regards to the dispute and vote, with the winner of the vote prevailing. Further, those users who vote may be subject to certain awards and punishments.

By means of such a method, disputes may be brought to light for more users, and more users can participation and contribute their opinions by means of a kind of DAO, thereby avoiding the problem of a centralized shopping center.

## Vision

Our goal in building the ShopFi platform is to carry out borderless purchasing without currency limitations, that is decentralized, is trustless, and which builds e-commerce 3.0 by means of combining traditional e-commerce and the characteristics of the blockchain.

Traditional e-commerce is separated, centralized, bordered, and has a threshold, these factors cause global consumers to be unable to freely promote the global flow of goods. At the same time, for cryptocurrency holders, they are unable to use cryptocurrency to make purchases. To a great degree this limited the initial applications of cryptocurrency and increased usage costs. We hope that we can allow cryptocurrency holders (i.e., consumers) the ability on a unified interface (even if the DApp manifest in different forms) to make purchases worldwide on different electronic commerce markets on ShopFi. After this, we will simplify online shopping flows, allowing consumers to obtain worldwide passage of excellent goods in a transparent and seamless manner. Further, the use of encrypted digital assets has the advantages of low cost, and does not require compromises in terms of quality, security, or convenience.

The mission of ShopFi is to become the first-choice platform and tool for encrypted asset users who are engaging in e-commerce activities. We have worked hard to develop a platform that makes use of the advanced technologies of the blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptography so that encrypted digital asset users and the most valuable e-commerce platforms worldwide can establish a seamless connection. Our mission is to make it possible for digital asset holders to use their cryptocurrency assets to make purchases and have use of products and services, within a unified tool and platform.
