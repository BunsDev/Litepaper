# Outline and history of Blockchain

The concept of the blockchain may be traced back to the end of 2008, by a person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious figure who published a paper in a forum, entitled "Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system," which was the first time that the concept of the blockchain had been proposed.

In the text it is mentioned that in order to resolve the security problems of e-currency, a time-stamped server can be one group, and a Hash can be made for data that is in a Block, afterwards a time stamp is applied to this. Thereafter, the Hash is transmitted. Each time stamp will include the previous time stamp within the Hash. Subsequent time stamps will strengthen previous time stamps, thus forming a "blockchain."

### **The value of blockchain: machine trust, value transference, smart contracts**

What is the value of blockchains that are produced? In fact, you can make a conclusion in regards to this based on the characteristics of the blockchain itself: the ability to have machine trust due to decentralization, peer-to-peer transactions, and falsification; value transference from the inability to trace transactions and information encryption; smart contracts can be implemented by point-to-point information and inability to falsify.

Machine trust. There is no third-party central organization for the blockchain, it entirely depends on peer-to-peer, and transaction mechanisms such as the impossibility of falsification, guaranteeing trust on both sides. The characteristic of it being impossible to falsify the blockchain, has changed the centralized creation of credit, and costs can be reduced by means of the use of mathematical principles and non-centralized credit structures, which can create credit.

Previously, I searched for an article from Yinnuo Finance, which is under Bubi, by a Chinese maker (Article "The use of blockchain to reshape supply chain finance, how can it carry out about enterprise credit transfers?")) Which is a blockchain application project that is using blockchain technology to carry out enterprise credit transfers.

Value transference. The blockchain is the first network that is capable of executing value transfers. On the one hand, simple value transfers allow for digital property to freely pass through the blockchain. On the other hand, the issuing of tokens makes financing more convenient, and at the same time holders can enjoy an entire ecosystem of services (for example a token is based on application production in a blockchain, holding the tokens means having application service).

Smart contracts. This clause is recorded in computer rather than legal language, and is in regards to the combination of electronic contracts and blockchain technology, when a predetermined programmed clause is initiated, the smart contract will execute the corresponding contractual clauses.

The advantages of such a smart contract are that on the one hand it reduces their contract singing costs, administration costs, and compliance costs, etc., especially when there are many daily transactions, and on the other hand, unilateral breaches of contract of one party can be stopped, and the performance of the contract according to the rules can be ensured.

### **Disadvantages of blockchain**

In fact, blockchain is an emerging technology, there certainly value in it, but there have also emerged some disadvantages.

One of these is low efficiency. Writing data into the blockchain at the least requires a wait of a few minutes, with all of the nodes being synchronized, even more time is required. Taking Bitcoin as an example, currently the effectiveness of making a transaction is subject to internet transmission, and the real time for a Bitcoin transaction is approximately 10 minutes, and a 6-time confirmation requires one hour.  Due to this the transaction data of blockchain is delayed.

A second disadvantage is energy consumption, since generation of blocks requires mining to carry out numberless hash calculations, this is incredibly energy intensive. According to a prediction that has been presented by a UK electrical informational network POWER-COMPARE, based on current Bitcoin mining, transactions, and the speed of power consumption growth, in a number of years the amount of energy consumed for Bitcoin will equal the entire worldwide consumption of energy at this current time. Though this data has been put into question, "mines" that are hidden in remote mountains and deep forests have truly revealed the energy consumption of this business.
