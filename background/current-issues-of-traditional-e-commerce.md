# Current issues of traditional e-commerce

As described above, although the e-commerce business in the last few years, especially following the huge contextual influence of COVID-19 has experienced significant development, it still has a number of problems that are global.

### 1. Territories and platform limitations

The majority of world e-markets currently are located in a small number of countries (such as, China, the US, and Japan, etc.), the figure below shows the 2021 distribution of e-commerce sales totals among countries.

Also, the majority of sales are all concentrated in a few mainstream platforms on a global basis, such as Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, etc., many platforms have national and regional limitations. Today, in a globalized context, this is a limitation on the global flow of products, causing many excellent quality products and services to be unable to have a good global distribution.

### 2. Payment limitations

Payment limitations are relatively harsher when comparing regional and platform limitations with payment limitations. Each platform has its own payment method, which are mutually incompatible. Of course, you can use an international credit card to make purchases, such as Visa and Mastercard, which for this reason receive bountiful receipts, and a few third-party payment platforms such as PayPal have extremely strict control measures, with a threshold that is also not low at all.

### 3.Trust and privacy protection

In traditional e-commerce, all product quality and after sales questions can only rely on a centralized shopping center. When there is a dispute, what you can do is submit a proof, then wait for the judgement of the shopping center with no other means being present. In the same way, centralized shopping centers manage too much personal private data, including transaction information, mailing addresses, purchasing trends, etc., so whenever a leak occurs, there will be a serious threat towards personal privacy and security.
