# Comparison

Let's go through how an order is processed and states are circulated on a traditional e-commerce mall, and how it differs from a regular transaction on a contemporary blockchain, Mainly in the following points:

1. Processes are much longer, and there are many intermediate states in between.&#x20;
2. The lifetime is much longer than a regular blockchain transaction, ranging from a few days to as long as a week. If cross-border transactions are involved, it may even reach a month.&#x20;
3. The process is not always the same. For example, it may involve complex processes, such as returns and exchanges.&#x20;
4. Involving third-party reliance such as logistics.&#x20;
5. Each status change needs to push a corresponding message to different parties.
