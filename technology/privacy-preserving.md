# Privacy Preserving

Each sub-order transaction saves info as little as possible besides the required ones; other info is stored on the decentralized storage. The primary order only keeps the most critical fields, and the info involving privacy will not be carried out on the chain. It will only be opened to the node responsible for order processing in a point-to-point manner, and only the private key of the corresponding node can be used to decrypt to keep it confidential and safe. Such information will be destroyed right after the order is completed, as shown in the following figure:
