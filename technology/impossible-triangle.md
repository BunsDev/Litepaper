1. Be decentralized as much as we can to form a mutual trust mechanism, which is the foundation of blockchain-based projects.
2. Security, it is necessary to ensure that the users' assets are always safe under all circumstances.
3. Scalability and performance, we must ensure this system covers as many users as possible. At the same time, we need to consider that the processing performance should support massive amounts of transactions.
4. In addition to the impossible triangle, we need to consider even more:&#x20;
   1. The cost of gas fee other than the order amount that the user needs to pay.&#x20;
   2. The order contains lots of private information. It is vital to make sure that this information will not be revealed or stolen, at the same time also ensure that the corresponding node and broker can process the order correctly.&#x20;
   3. Connection and traceability of each step of the transaction.
