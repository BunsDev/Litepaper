# Glossary

> **ShopFi Global**
>
> A decentralized protocol, consisting of a series of components, including smart contracts, clients and nodes and other infrastructure and services, allows cryptocurrency holders to use cryptocurrencies to purchase products and services around the world, and enjoy advantages of lower costs, privacy protection and security.

> **ShopFi DAO**
>
> This will be a community that will be off chain and does not require consuming GAS at the start, where the governance committee can publish new proposals on ShopFi Global or vote on proposals that already exist. In early stages, proposals will be implemented by ShopFi Global on a discretionary basis. In the future control will be devolved to a more decentralized and open smart contract system for implementation, permitting the community to have more ability to make proposals and have control.

> **Buyers**
>
> Refers to cryptocurrency holders and consumers who intend to use ShopFi to make purchases globally.

> **Sellers**
>
> Refers to store**s** in a traditional malls such as Amazon, Alibaba and Walmart, which can be an individual or a company. In a future version, sellers can also directly open store merchants in ShopFi.

> **Brokers**
>
> Refers to brokers who pledge the corresponding $ShopFi in ShopFi to get qualified. This role will perform a series of actions for the buyer to complete the traditional transaction in the designated mall according to dispatched order including shipping goods or services to the buyer's designated address.

> **Nodes**
>
> Refers to servers running in the ShopFi Global after pledging a certain amount of $ShopFi token. Those servers are responsible for performing various tasks specified by ShopFi and obtaining corresponding incentives through Proof of Procedures (PoP).

> **Proof of Procedures**
>
> A consensus that's used within ShopFi Global for all roles. Nodes need to help protecting the system by keeping all procedures of orders to be finished normally. Base on this, all nodes will be rewarded correspondingly.

> **Trades**
>
> Refers to a traditional e-commerce transaction initiated by a buyer to a seller, and the transaction will be executed through a broker or automatic node.

> **Transactions**
>
> Refers to transaction**s** between buyers, brokers and sellers (in the future) in ShopFi. All publicable transaction data will be recorded fairly and openly by the smart contract. The corresponding key data will be stored in the smart contract, and other non-key public information will be stored in decentralized storage onchain (such as IPFS and Arweave, etc.). Private / sensitive information will not be stored anywhere, and will be destroyed after use.

> **Developers**
>
> ShopFi is an open ecosystem that supports connection to various malls. Developers refer to technicians/experts who use ShopFi’s protocol, SDK, and documentation to access ShopFi’s ecology in order to obtain corresponding rewards.

> **DApps**
>
> Refers to Decentralized Applications that use ShopFi's protocol, SDK, and documentation. These applications may be officially developed on ShopFi or produced by third-party community developers. Users can use these DApps to perform corresponding operations on ShopFi.

> **$ShopFi Token**
>
> Refers to the token issued by ShopFi Network, which will empower the ecology from all aspects and encourage participants in all ways to make their own contributions to the development of the ecology. The $ShopFi token will be issued using the ERC20 standard. For details, please refer to the following chapter: Tokenomics.

> **Token Holders**
>
> Refers to users who believe in the future development of the ShopFi ecosystem and are holding $ShopFi tokens. Token holders will have different rights in different perspectives.

> **SIP (ShopFi Improvement Proposals)**
>
> Refers to the proposals released in the DAO community for the development of the ShopFi ecology. The proposal can only be released by members of the governance committee, while other users can vote on this proposal. In the early stage, ShopFi Global decides whether to implement a certain proposal. In the future, the community will gradually be given more autonomy.
